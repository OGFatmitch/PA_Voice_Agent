# Voice Agent Latency Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to reduce latency in the voice agent conversation.

## üöÄ Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Streaming Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
- **What**: TTS generation and playback happen asynchronously
- **Impact**: Reduces response time by ~2-3 seconds per interaction
- **How**: `speakStreaming()` method starts TTS generation and returns immediately
- **Config**: `ENABLE_STREAMING_TTS=true` (default)

### 2. **Response Caching**
- **What**: Pre-generates audio for common responses
- **Impact**: Instant playback for frequently used responses
- **How**: Common responses are generated at startup and cached
- **Config**: `PRELOAD_RESPONSES=true` (default)

### 3. **Reduced Recording Time**
- **What**: Shorter maximum recording duration
- **Impact**: Faster turn-taking, less waiting
- **How**: Reduced from 10s to 5s maximum recording time
- **Config**: `MAX_RECORDING_TIME=5` (default)

### 4. **Faster Silence Detection**
- **What**: Reduced silence detection threshold
- **Impact**: Stops recording sooner when user finishes speaking
- **How**: Silence threshold reduced from 1.0s to 0.5s
- **Config**: Built-in optimization

### 5. **Parallel Processing**
- **What**: Non-blocking operations where possible
- **Impact**: Reduced overall processing time
- **How**: Audio playback and processing happen concurrently
- **Config**: `ENABLE_PARALLEL_PROCESSING=true` (default)

### 6. **Optimized LLM Processing**
- **What**: Improved information extraction and answer processing
- **Impact**: Faster understanding of user input
- **How**: Better prompts and structured output parsing
- **Config**: Built-in optimization

## üìä Expected Performance Improvements

| Optimization | Latency Reduction | Use Case |
|--------------|------------------|----------|
| Streaming TTS | 2-3 seconds | All responses |
| Response Caching | 1-2 seconds | Common responses |
| Reduced Recording | 2-5 seconds | User input |
| Faster Silence Detection | 0.5-1 second | User input |
| Parallel Processing | 0.5-1 second | Overall |
| **Total** | **6-12 seconds** | **Per interaction** |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Add these environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Enable/disable optimizations (all default to true)
ENABLE_STREAMING_TTS=true
PRELOAD_RESPONSES=true
ENABLE_PARALLEL_PROCESSING=true
MAX_RECORDING_TIME=5

# Voice settings
VOICE_SPEED=1.0
VOICE_MODEL=nova
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the latency test to measure improvements:

```bash
node test_latency.js
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If responses are too fast:
- Set `ENABLE_STREAMING_TTS=false` for traditional blocking TTS
- Increase `MAX_RECORDING_TIME` if users need more time to speak

### If responses are too slow:
- Ensure `PRELOAD_RESPONSES=true`
- Check internet connection for API calls
- Consider using a faster voice model

### If audio quality is poor:
- Adjust `VOICE_SPEED` (lower = slower but clearer)
- Try different `VOICE_MODEL` options

## üìà Monitoring

The agent logs performance metrics:
- `üéµ Using cached audio response` - Cached response used
- `‚è±Ô∏è TTS generation: XXXms` - TTS generation time
- `üîß Corrected transcription` - Transcription corrections

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Keep responses concise** - Shorter responses generate faster
2. **Use common phrases** - These get cached for instant playback
3. **Speak clearly** - Reduces transcription errors and re-processing
4. **Wait for prompts** - Don't interrupt the agent while it's speaking

## üîÆ Future Optimizations

Potential future improvements:
- **WebSocket streaming** for real-time audio
- **Local TTS models** for offline operation
- **Predictive caching** based on conversation flow
- **Audio compression** for faster transmission
- **Edge computing** for reduced API latency
